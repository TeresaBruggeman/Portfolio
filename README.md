Welcome to Teresa B's Portfolio site.
The site uses HTML5, CSS, and the BootStrap CSS famework to make the site semantic, accessible, and responsive. It also utilizes JavaScript and jQuery for functionality.
The site contains three pages: 
  The Bio or Home page, which contains information about and a photograph of me.
  The Portfolio page, which will be a gallery of images represening my projects with links to deeper explorations of each of them.
  The Contact page, which provides visitors with an easy method for sending messages, comments, or inquiries to me.
Stay tuned...this is still a work in progress.
