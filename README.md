This web site will be my future portfolio site to showcase my work and abilities to the world.

The site uses HTML5, CSS, and the BootStrap CSS famework to make the site semantic, accessible, and responsive. The site contains three pages at this point: The Bio or Home page, which contains information about and a photograph of me. The Portfolio page, which will be a gallery of images represening my projects with links to deeper explorations of each of them. The Contact page, which provides an easy method to the user for sending messages or comments or inquiries to me. Stay tuned...this is going to be awesome.
